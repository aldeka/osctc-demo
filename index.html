            <p>Open Source Comes to Campus is a curriculum designed for newcomers to open source. We've honed the workshop over three years of practice with 20 student groups, minimizing social, technical, and knowledge dependencies. Now you can run an inviting event like that, too.</p></div>

            <p>As the organizer of a local event, you'll get all the teaching resources you need: slides, hands-on exercises for students, and more. We'll help you find professional programers to help during the event, and curate "bitesize bugs" so your attendees have a gentle on-ramp into a real open source project.

            <p>Open Source Comes to Campus is a day-long, hands-on workshop. In the morning, students learn about version control; the history of open source; how open source communities communicate on bug trackers, IRC, and mailing lists; and attend a career panel to understand how open source plays a part in professionals' lives. In the afternoon, students work together with existing open source projects to make real changes to projects people use.

            a fee, we would be happy to accept it, but we will not turn you away
